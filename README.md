This project serves as a basic online shop for a local baker. The home page contains a carousel with images of the products 
offered by the baker as well as an "About us" section providing a descriton of the company. The home page will also provide 
a nav bar with hyperlinks to either the "Menu" page or the "Place Your Order" page. The menu page consists of two centered
columns that display the menu items and pricing. This page also has a nav bar that can direct the user either to the home page
or the "Place Your Order" page. The "Place Your Order" page consists of an HTML form in which the user can input contact information,
place their order, and enter a method of payment. This last page also provides a nav bar that the user can utilize to navigate back to the 
home page or menu page. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The site can improve on color schemes, Javascript
logic to improve the form page, and more interactivity.
