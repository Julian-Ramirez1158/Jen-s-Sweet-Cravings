This project serves as a basic online shop for a local baker. The home page contains an "About us" section providing a descriton of the company. The home page and each subsequent page is displayed with a header banner and will also provide a nav bar with hyperlinks to either the "Home" page, "Menu" page or the "Order" page. The menu page consists of a flexbox of various images that display the menu items and pricing. The "Order" page consists of an HTML form in which the user can input contact information, place their order, and enter a method of payment. The technologies used in this project are HTML and CSS. The site can improve on integrating Javascript logic to improve the form page, adding more images to the "Menu" page, and adding a credit card "checkout" section in the "Place Your Order" page.
